{
 ...
 "castlecraft_auth_header_enabled": 1,
 "castlecraft_auth_jwt_verify_bearer_enabled": 1,
 "castlecraft_auth_introspect_bearer_enabled": 1,
 "castlecraft_client_id": "client_id_or_allowed_aud_claim",
 "castlecraft_client_secret": "client_secret",
 "castlecraft_create_user_on_auth_enabled": 1,
 "castlecraft_introspect_token_key": "access_token",

}
```

- `castlecraft_auth_header_enabled`: When set to `1`, token is introspection endpoint uses basic auth with `client_id` and `client_secret`.
- `castlecraft_auth_jwt_verify_bearer_enabled`: When set to `1`, token is assumed to be jwt and verified using JWKS.
- `castlecraft_auth_introspect_bearer_enabled`: When set to `1`, token is introspected to validate user.
- `castlecraft_client_id`: Registered `client_id`.
- `castlecraft_client_secret`: Registered `client_secret`.
- `castlecraft_create_user_on_auth_enabled`: When set to `1`, user with no roles will be created if not found in system.
- `castlecraft_introspect_token_key`: Key used to pass token to introspection endpoint. Defaults to `token`. Example request will have `token=abc123`.
- `castlecraft_introspect_url`: Token introspection url.
- `castlecraft_userinfo_url`: User info url.
- `castlecraft_auth_server_url`: Authorization Server url.
- `castlecraft_admin_server_url`: Admin Server url for tenant management.
- `castlecraft_jwks_url`: JWKS URL required in case `castlecraft_auth_jwt_verify_bearer_enabled` is set to `1`

Note: Either set `castlecraft_auth_introspect_bearer_enabled` or `castlecraft_auth_jwt_verify_bearer_enabled`, NOT both. In case both are set, auth `castlecraft_auth_introspect_bearer_enabled` will be considered.
